                  Brand protection combats the loss of revenue, reputation and customer trust that occurs when someone else exploits once brand for their own gain.
                  The webâ€™s tremendous reach and economies of scale have revolutionized the way brands engage customers and drive revenue. But the very qualities that 
                  make the web so attractive to legitimate business make it extremely lucrative for brand abusers to hijack powerful brands online. Threats to your brand can
                  come from anyone, anywhere.   
                </p>
