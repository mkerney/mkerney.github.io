                                    Insurance carriers face steady pressures to increase customer acquisition and loyalty, reduce costs, and offer innovative acquisition and customer service business models. Underwriting is playing an increasingly central role by using its actuarial expertise to influence the design of new products, monitor and adapt to risks on an ongoing basis, and encourage upsell of appropriate, additional coverage for customers. Meanwhile, evolving risks in growing markets including natural catastrophes/environmental change and cyber-attacks are creating opportunities and new challenges.

                                    The core underwriting function must address several objectives in this environment:

                        Each major feature of ELEMENT of Insurance addresses a specific business activity or role in the customer lifecycle:
                      </p>
                      <h4><strong>Guided Dialogue for Customer Information Capture.</strong></h4>
                      <p>
                        For policy quotes, customers are looking for the best of both worlds - a human touch for sophisticated interaction, plus automated interaction for efficiency and 24-hour access. ELEMENT provides A.I.-based chat interactions (chatbots), natural language processing, and contextual analytics to respond to an inquirer, guide them to provide the pertinent information needed to underwrite the policy, and automatically interpret materials including text documents to understand the inquirer’s circumstances. From the agent orbroker’s viewpoint, “cases” such as new quotes are presented alongside the status of the customer’s information compilation and the latest chat transcripts.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        ELEMENT integrates your traditional, internal data sources about customers and prospects and combines that with unstructured text documents, news and relationship information gathered from public sources, as well as any geo-positional and telemetry/activity monitoring data. Our software builds an up-to-the-moment picture of the inquirer’s situation, executive staff, relationships with third parties, and pertinent transactions. It then applies machine learning to uncover patterns in that data that could affect one’s risk profile, based on comparisons to thousands of similar situations. Deep Learning is the next paradigm for risk modelling, and ELEMENT of Insurance makes its insights available to the underwriting team with minimal time investment in A.I./data science ramp up.

This information is centralized in a Case Management view, with alerts about changing situations that automatically initiate remediating actions and workflows. Underwriters, agents and brokers also can use hypothesis testing to forecast the benefit to the insured and carrier of mitigating exposures and/or increasing coverage.

BlackSwan is well versed at understanding the needs of this sector, given its executives' experience in governmental and commercial intelligence/security operations and technology. </p>

                      <p>At the heart of this application edition is a Cyber-Threat Intelligence Hub. It first is involved in the underwriting process by guiding the agent/broker and prospect through information compilation about its operational and technological infrastructure as related to digital activities. Data sources used include open source intelligence (OSINT), industry threat databases and geo-locational data, as well as cross-industry, cyber-threat benchmarking. The outcome is a comprehensive mapping of all assets and related entities that impact an organisation’s cyber defenses, quantified assessment of risks, and recommendations for personalized cyber-insurance package.</p>

It also learns, post facto, about the impact of attacks across the economy and adjusts its risk and economic models accordingly.
