                <h4>
                  <strong>Designed for Enterprises.</strong>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  ELEMENT thrives in business environments where industry-specific expertise and sophisticated business processes must be supported. ELEMENT’s search and analytic engines comprehend the entities, relationships and terminology specific to your business. Information is searched, captured and correlated in a central intelligence store, while individual departments receive custom views of the information. Built-in alerts, workflows and integration with your transactional systems turn these insights into action. Our customers achieve not only substantial business performance improvements but revolutionary new ways to design their business models and strategies for market leadership.

                <h4><strong>Self-Sufficient Customisation</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  ELEMENT readily adapts to your organization’s specific requirements and environment. Based on changes to the information it monitors, the software’s Business Process Manager can automatically initiate workflows and alerts you define targeted at specific groups of users. Industry-common integration methods include traditional and non-relational data query methods, and REST APIs. With ELEMENT’s Management Hub module and visually-oriented methods of configuring data sources and business logic, customers become self-sufficient in ongoing customisation.
                </p>

                <h4><strong>Scalability</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  ELEMENT’s data acquisition and management engine, Gravity Hub, readily addresses the four well-known V’s of big data - volume, variety, velocity and veracity - while adding two more: visualisation and value. Gravity Hub can assimilate any number of data points, including structured and unstructured data, temporal and geospatial feeds. The number of corporate and public data sources it taps into is effectively limitless. ELEMENT's analytic engine,, Kinetic Hub, adapts its understanding of the situation in real time based on a combination of Data Science and AIT technologies and methodologies. Kinetic Hub also is adept at resolving ambiguous data, identifying which version of a data point is likely to be more correct and timely, and which data entities require merger. Most importantly, ELEMENT always presents insights and recommendations to users in an intuitive manner, highlighting those relationships and trends that affect decision-making right now.
                </p>

                <h4><strong>Governance</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  Cognitive computing represents data, learning and actions in new ways compared to traditional databases and transactional systems. Your technologists need a robust means of managing these enterprise intelligence applications, while your security and compliance teams must be confident they are adhering to business policies and regulations. ELEMENT delivers on these requirements via its Management Hub module. It provides a centralized console for configuring the application(s) and controlling access. Use a drag & drop interface to define data pipelines then build business logic and policy enforcement rules. Monitor computing tasks. Control user access according to configurable domains, security clearance or job level. When needed, reference the audit trail of all data changes and user actions.
                </p>

                <h4><strong>Flexible Licensing</strong></h4>
                <p>

                </p>

                <h4><strong>Enterprise A.I.</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  At BlackSwan, we believe A.I. should mean the Augmentation and Acceleration of Intelligence for your enterprise and partners. That’s why we refer to ELEMENT as an Enterprise A.I. Operating System. Applications built on our ELEMENT software become embedded within an enterprise’s DNA, enabling advanced decisioning capabilities across-the-board, through intelligently curated information at one’s fingertips.
