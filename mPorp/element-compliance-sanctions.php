                            <h4><strong>The Challenge</strong></h4>
                            <div class="">
                                <div class="media-body">
                                    <p>
                                        Stringent economic sanctions (ES) regulations imply that a financial institution faces reputational risk and the potential for severe fines with every customer they onboard and every transaction they process. All the while, ES regulations are evolving as are the variety of watchlists. Customer data is dynamic as well, reflecting the changing nature of their businesses and locations of operation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Given the complexity of ES screening and the cost of overlooking a relationship or transaction involving a sanctioned entity or jurisdiction, financial institutions traditionally resort to common but costly  approaches.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The institutions subscribe to expensive watchlist feeds and then use multiple, generically-tuned screening systems for both relationship scanning and transactional scanning. Overall, this approach has satisfied regulators, but it places a significant operational burden on the compliance program. Multiple systems have to be updated with new regulatory requirements. Growing resources are required to handle the backlog of false positives. In addition, regulators are beginning to expect financial institutions to incorporate an array of available, unstructured information into their screening process.
                                    </p>

                                BlackSwan has emerged as a technological leader in the compliance space, where its approach is built upon a knowledge graph that creates, in real-time, one of the most comprehensive representations of all entities and the relationships that are relevant for a successful compliance program. BlackSwan’s ES compliance capabilities are made available via ELEMENT of Compliance, our software application that rests atop that knowledge graph. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-2">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-sm-10">

                                        Within the application, customer data obtained during onboarding is used to create each customer’s representation within the graph. Watchlists are sourced directly from within the application and aggregated to form a consolidated, graph-based profile for each sanctioned entity or jurisdiction. Using contextual analytics and entity resolution algorithms, each unique watchlist entity within the graph merges the variations across the multiple lists while still maintaining data lineage and versioning.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Customer and watchlist records continuously are enriched with the universe of available but unstructured information from global news outlets, social media, company profiles, the dark web, and others sources, using data mining and natural language processing capabilities. This approach delivers the most complete and up-to-date viewpoint available for each customer and watchlist entity.

                                    <p>
                                        As a customer performs transactions or as new information becomes available (e.g., adverse news), the knowledge graph evolves over time. If any linkage is made between a customer and a sanctioned entity, the compliance offer is alerted immediately to potential ES risk

                                        A distinct aspect of ES compliance is the sizable, potential penalties for failing to detect a sanctioned entity. Thus, leveraging all forms of screening information and detecting matches in real-time is essential.

                                        While other compliance solutions claim to have accurate matching algorithms for economic sanctions, they overlook the wealth of available but unstructured information that adds a significant lift within the screening process for resolving true hits and reducing false positives.  ELEMENT of Compliance combines unstructured and structured data within the formation of its knowledge graph in real-time, meaning the variety of ES related risks are identified instantaneously and escalated for review.
