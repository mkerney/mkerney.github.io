                The company was founded in 2014 by a visionary executive and entrepreneur with a background at Oracle in national and cyber security applications, as well as at a governmental intelligence agency. He formed a core team that has grown to include a world expert in natural language processing, a co-author of the book “Towards Data Science,” and a quantitative financial analyst at Bank of America. The team took several years to perfect the cognitive computing capabilities in ELEMENT with leading global enterprises, before commercially releasing the application in 2018. We have been highlighted in KPMG/H2 Ventures’ rankings as a rising star in our field.
