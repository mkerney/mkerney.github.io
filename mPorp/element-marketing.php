                  <strong>Challenges</strong>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Marketers are increasingly dependent on analyzing volumes of data to guide their tactics. At the
                  same time, customers are expecting more personalized interactions with your brand. For
                  enterprises to meet both goals, they require a leading-edge software platform that augments the
                  intelligence applied across your entire organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Introducing <b>ELEMENT of Marketing,</b> from BlackSwan Technologies. ELEMENT is our
                  Enterprise A.I. Operating System, with the latest capabilities for big data, A.I., cognitive
                  computing and contextual analysis. It has been pre-configured for specific business functions
                  including Marketing, yet is customisable to your organisation’s strategy and operations
                </p>

                  <strong>ELEMENT of Marketing's Capabilities</strong>
                </h4>
                <p>
                  ELEMENT of Marketing delivers the insights you need to succeed in pursuing a range of
                  marketing strategies. The capabilities below are available as individual modules or as an
                  integrated intelligence system for marketing:

                  <li>
                    <b>Affinity Marketing for Lead Generation:</b> One of the top techniques employed in one-to-one
                    marketing is identification of similar traits and behaviors between loyal customers and
                    prospects, in order to optimize the communications and product offerings delivered to
                    prospects. A challenge can be that there is insufficient data accessible about either customer or
                    prospects to make affinity marketing effective. ELEMENT of Marketing addresses this through
                    inferred behavioral analysis. For example, a company will possess product purchase
                    information for existing customers, but have access only to aggregate credit card purchase
                    expenses, without knowledge of the products purchased. ELEMENT of Marketing can infer
                    customer needs and purchase preferences by cross-correlating known activities from existing
                    customers with similar demographic profiles, who have given permission to share data.
                    More precisely segment traget audiences and insightfully define customer persona.

                  <li>
                    <b>Customer Journey</b> takes lead generation another step forward, by extracting insights from every
                    step the customer takes with you – before, during and after purchase. With Element’s deep
                    learning engine autonomously scanning for correlations between behavior and sales, you can
                    ask questions such as: What are typical paths that customers take between product research
                    and purchase? How does a prospect’s response time between steps affect the likelihood that
                    they need assistance or ultimately make a purchase? Who are likely influencers of 
                    consumers’ decisions? With ELEMENT for Marketing’s customer journey capabilities, you
                    decide which steps along the path you measure, and ELEMENT presents the findings it derives.
                    The software’s analysis extends beyond determining direct sales drivers... to identify synergies
                    among possible drivers of sales and enable you to simulate customer experiences and predict
                    the outcomes from different strategies.

                  <li>
                    <b>Intelligent Dialogue:</b> For many purchasers, there are times when self-guided product research is
                    more efficient and desirable than dialing through a phone tree, waiting for an email response or
                    poring over a website. Here is where intelligent dialogue (chatbot technology) comes into play.
                    Intelligent dialogue can supplement, and at times replace, person-to-person chats while yielding
                    several advantages. They instantaneously can look up any known information about a customer
                    or returning prospect for context about relevant products or circumstances then guide the
                    dialogue efficiently to capture additional data needed to serve the customer.
                    <br><br>
                    Guided interactions can be presented directly to your customers, or interfaced with your sales
                    reps, customer agents to reduce the amount of researching and typing, and
                    increase their time available for problem solving. This is especially value if your product or
                    service involves in-depth information compilation from new customers. Your team will see, in
                    parallel with the dialogue history, the status of user profile building and a case
                    management/CRM overview. ELEMENT of Marketing’s support for natural language queries,
                    sentiment comprehension, contextual analytics and customer dashboard turn chatbots into a
                    strategic tool to increase customer dialogue and satisfaction while creating operational
                    efficiencies.

                    <b>Account-Based Marketing</b> turns the traditional marketing funnel upside-down. Instead of casting
                    a wide net for prospects then qualifying them via interactions, ABM begins by targeting specific
                    organizations that are a good fit for your offerings, then expands one’s understanding of their
                    situation and related entities that influence the sales cycle. ELEMENT, in seconds, can build a
                    situational profile of any company based on public and privileged sources, including a
                    relationship graph of related subsidiaries, third-party providers and other entities that work with
                    it. This is particularly valuable with SMEs and private companies, as commercial information
                    database offer limited information about these kinds of firms.

                  <li>
                    <b>Customer Satisfaction</b> activities in most organizations are fragmented, with assessments
                    collected through a variety of approaches by different departments. Marketing runs customer
                    surveys; Sales captures notes from conversations; Customer Service measures issues logged
                    and response times; and everyone awaits the Net Promoter’s Score while hoping satisfaction
                    improves profitability. There has to be a more insightful and coordinated means of tracking
                    customer satisfaction and its effect, and ELEMENT of Marketing can play a key role. ELEMENT
                    uses A.I. techniques to understand conversations - customer messages, call notes and
                    transcriptions of calls, and social media comments - and can extract sentiment assessments. Its
                    big data integration with your internal and off-the-shelf systems and public conversation
                    sources, plus deep learning/machine language engine, analyze all the measures of customer
                    satisfaction, then correlates all aspects of customer interaction to provide the real reason behind
                    a customer’s sentiment. ELEMENT’s analytics recognize that customer loyalty is highly timeand
                    experience-sensitive. It can even predict adverse responses like customer churn or online
                    complaints, and alert the right team members to reach out proactively and rectify issues.

                  <li>
                    <b>Content Personalization:</b> A recent study found that content marketing is considered CMO’s
                    number one strategy for 2018 to improve the relevancy and impact of customer
                    communications. Marketers have realized this and are creating blogs, videos, e-books and
                    native placement of edutainment to engage customers. However, there is still a dependence on
                    static web pages and search as the means of getting customers/prospects to find the most
                    relevant content for themselves. Imagine instead, if artificial intelligence software, with
                    permission, discretely observed the content a web visitor observes and compared this to the
                    engagement by prior visitors. Then, content is reprioritized so that the most likely relevant
                    material appears most prominently. ELEMENT also has natural language processing
                    capabilities to interpret video transcripts, and automatically interpret the relevancy of video
                    content to specific users.

                  <li>
                    <b>Data Enrichment and Privacy:</b> Rich profiles about individuals are a powerful tool for marketing
                    and sales. Global data privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data
                    Protection Rule (GDPR), are changing the way that companies are permitted to collect
                    information about individuals and communicate with them. GDPR requires that any E.U.
                    resident gives explicit permission before information is collected by a company or analysis is
                    performed about that person. ELEMENT of Marketing addresses this requirement in a novel
                    way. When searching the web and other external data source for information about an
                    individual, ELEMENT first interprets the residency and/or access location of that individual, then checks in real-time
                    with your CRM records about whether they have given permission for data enrichment of their
                    profile. If not, the data search can be halted before any records are adding to your systems.
                    ELEMENT even is smart about disambiguating whether multiple sources of information referring
                    to multiple entities with the same name have a strong likelihood to be the exact same person,
                    and only enriching information about those people who have given permission.
