                BlackSwan's Market Intelligence application is the first autonomous, 
                continuously-evolving index of companies worldwide. It includes in-depth profiles, 
                relationship graphs and customisable quantitative and qualitative analysis. The application
                 is ideal for researching private businesses, for whom data can be scarce and the effort to 
                 compile insights, time consuming. Use cases include deal flow origination, M&A due diligence,
                  investment book production, competitive benchmarking, SWOT assessment, and more.
